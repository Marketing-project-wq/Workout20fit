# 20FIT — Product Requirements (Data Model & Taxonomy)

> Living doc kept in sync with the bundled app (`Workout 20FIT (1).html`).
> All program/exercise names & descriptions are **representative placeholders**
> and must be reviewed by a 20FIT coach before going live, consistent with the
> in-app guidance disclaimer.

## 6.2 Exercise Filter (two dimensions)

The Exercise menu filters programs on **two independent dimensions**, each on its
own labelled chip row. Users can combine one from each (e.g. `Yoga` + `Turunkan
Berat Badan`).

- **Jenis Latihan** (exercise type, single-select): `Semua, HYROX, Functional,
  Yoga, Pilates, HIIT, Strength` — 6 types.
- **Tujuan** (goal, single-select): `Semua, Turunkan Berat Badan, Bangun Otot,
  Daya Tahan, Kebugaran & Pemulihan` — 4 goals.

After a Jenis **or** a Tujuan is picked, a secondary **duration sub-filter**
appears (`Semua durasi / 20-40 menit / 40-60 menit`, derived from the durations
present in the current result set), plus a **`N PROGRAM` count label** above the
list. Both chip rows, the duration sub-filter and the count are **data-driven
and reusable** — new programs inherit the behaviour with no per-category code.

> **NOT YET INCLUDED (needs confirmation):** connected-cardio types — Running,
> Cycling, Rowing, Elliptical, Walking. Do not generate these as a Jenis until
> 20FIT confirms it has the relevant connected equipment.

## 8. Data Model

### 8.1 Program

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | string | Unique, `p<N>` |
| `name` | string | Display name (ID); English via translation map |
| `icon` | string | Icon key |
| `jenis` | string | **single** value — one of `hyrox, functional, yoga, pilates, hiit, strength` |
| `tujuan` | string[] | **array** — subset of `turun_bb, otot, daya_tahan, wellness` (a program may serve several goals) |
| `duration` | string | `"20-40 menit"` / `"40-60 menit"` (EN `min`) |
| `desc` | string | Short description (ID); English via translation map |
| `exercises` | via `wp[id]` | Ordered list of exercises |

> Provisional mapping note (for coach review): mobility/recovery programs are
> currently filed under `jenis: yoga` since none of the 6 types is a dedicated
> "Mobility" discipline. Revisit if a Mobility type is added.

### 8.2 Exercise

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id`, `name`, `level`, `benefit`, `howTo{steps,mistakes,tips}` | — | localized via EN map |
| `equipment` | string[] | `bodyweight (Tanpa alat), dumbbell, kettlebell, matras, resistance band, sled, …` |
| `zones` | string[] | **muscle_group** — primary muscles / focus zones |
| `location` | string[] | `home` / `gym` |
| `movementPattern` | string | `squat, hinge, push, pull, core, balance, cardio, mobility` |
| `kategoriAsal` | string | Jenis where the exercise first originated |

## 8.3 Goal / Type Taxonomy

Each **Jenis** should offer **3–6 program variants** with sensible **Tujuan**
combinations (not every goal forced onto every type — e.g. HIIT → Turun BB &
Daya Tahan; Strength → Bangun Otot & Daya Tahan; Yoga → Kebugaran & Pemulihan +
Turun BB). Program naming pattern: **`[Jenis] untuk [Sub-tujuan]`** or a
descriptive equivalent.

## Variation Rules & Overlap Checker

1. Within a program: vary `movementPattern` & `equipment`; avoid repeating the
   same pattern repeatedly.
2. Between programs: exercise overlap must be the minority — target **≤ ~20–30%**
   for adjacent-theme programs; most exercises in each program should feel new.
3. Expand the exercise library as needed to support (2) — not capped at the
   original 70.
4. **Pre-publish validation:** `tools/overlap_check.py` flags program pairs whose
   exercise sets exceed the overlap threshold, and programs with low
   movement-pattern variety. Run it before shipping catalog changes:
   ```
   python3 tools/overlap_check.py --threshold 0.30
   ```

## Landing Stats

The landing stat tiles are computed from live data (program count, total
exercise/session count, goal count) so they never go stale when the catalog
changes.

## Rollout

Staged: validate the variation pattern on **Yoga & HIIT** first, then roll out
to the remaining 4 Jenis. Current status: filter structure, data model,
metadata tagging, overlap checker, and landing stats are in place; program
variants exist for all 6 Jenis but the exercise-library expansion needed to hit
the overlap target (rule 2) is pending — start with Yoga & HIIT.
